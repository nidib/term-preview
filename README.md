## ðŸŽ¯ About
Tired of having to lookup your terms on the web every time? Then this extension will be pretty handy!</br>
Simply install it and configure it to see them without ever leaving the IDE.
</br></br>

## âœ¨ Getting started
After installing it, you basically need to let this extension know of three things: </br>
1. The absolute location to your terms folder
2. The file name
3. A list of languages to have the terms translated to

You can configure it using the VS Code UI, or through the `json` configuration following the example below:
```json
{
  "termPreview.absolutePathToTermsRoot": "/Users/john/your-project/language/terms",
  "termPreview.file": "{{LANGUAGE}}.utf-8.po",
  "termPreview.languages": ["en-us", "pt-br"],
}
```
</br></br>


## ðŸš€ Upcoming features
- [ ] An user-friendly interface with a searchable list of your terms
- [ ] Right click on a term to see it on the web
</br></br>
